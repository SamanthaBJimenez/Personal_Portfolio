                        I aspired to have a career I was passionate about and never looked back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a former Secretary of an elementary school in South Williamburg. I originally went to college for Accounting but decided to take some time to find a career path I was more passionate about. After extensive research I discovered that software engineering was a field that combined the analytical skills Iâ€™ve developed so far in my career, with my desire to build and create. Since then I discovered Pursuit, a software engineering fellowship, and have grown to appreciate all things full stack.
